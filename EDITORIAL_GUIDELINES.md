# Editorial Guidelines

## Dual-Portal Content Strategy
Content must be **direction-specific** - each piece serves one clear relocation direction:
- **Hungarian Site** (`audience: hu-to-uk`): Hungarians moving to UK
- **English Site** (`audience: to-hungary`): Anyone moving to Hungary

## Tone & audience
- Clear, official-style guidance; no legal advice.
- Plain English for English site; plain Hungarian for Hungarian site
- Short sentences; front-load actions.

## Content Rules
### Hungarian Site Content (`hu-to-uk` + `locale: hu`)
- Focus: UK visa processes, British settlement, English requirements
- Examples: "Skilled Worker víza", "NHS regisztráció", "Londoni lakáskeresés"
- Language: Hungarian only

### English Site Content (`to-hungary` + `locale: en`)  
- Focus: Hungary permits, Budapest living, Hungarian systems
- Examples: "Hungary Residence Permits", "Budapest Housing", "Hungarian Healthcare"
- Language: English only

## Canonical structure (Guides)
1. Summary (2–3 bullets)
2. Who this applies to
3. Documents needed
4. Steps (numbered)
5. Timing & fees
6. After you apply
7. Links to official sources
8. Last updated (date + reviewer)

## WordPress Taxonomy Requirements
- **Audience**: Must specify `hu-to-uk` OR `to-hungary` (never both)
- **Locale**: Must match content language (`hu` or `en`)
- **Topic**: Use standard tags (`work`, `study`, `healthcare`, `housing`, `finance`, `legal`)

## Quality gates
- Fact-checked; two sources minimum (incl. official)
- Last-updated date required
- **Direction-specific**: Content must serve one clear audience and relocation direction
- **No content overlap**: Hungarian and English sites serve completely different purposes
