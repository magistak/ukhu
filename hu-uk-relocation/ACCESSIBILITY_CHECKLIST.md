# Accessibility Checklist (MVP)

- Keyboard navigation: all interactive elements focusable
- Labels: every input has `<label>` or aria-label
- Color contrast: text meets WCAG AA
- Alt text: informative images; decorative images `alt=""`
- Headings: logical order h1→h2→h3
- Focus states: visible and non-reliant on color alone
- Language attr on `<html>` per locale
